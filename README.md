# wesfix_android
WesFix android app for Wesleyan Physical Plant, from (https://wesfix.wesleyan.edu/)

This is a basic backbone for WesFix App taken from the WesFix website (wesfix.wesleyan.edu). Currently this commit only contains basic layout design and activities movement. Not including the backend. Hopefully will be done next semester.
